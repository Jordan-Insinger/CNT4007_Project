What we Achieved: 
We managed to implement everything that the document required. Which is to create a peer with java peerProcess [PEERID]. When other peers are created, it will connect to the previous peers with a intial handshake, then send messages which will enable the download of files from the peers’ that contain a file within their folder. All peers will have the same files by the end of the download.

Playbook: 
Initial creation
Follow steps in order:

1. “tar -xvf P2P.tar”  - to unzip the file.
2. “javac *.java” - to initialize all of the java files
3. “Java peerProcess -id-” - Will run a file using our peerProcess implementation.
