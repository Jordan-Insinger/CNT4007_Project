What we Achieved: We managed to implement everything that the document required. Which is to create a peer with java peerProcess -ID-. When other peers are created, it will connect to the previous peers with a intial hanshake, then send messages which will enable the download of files from the peers’ that contain a file within their folder. All peers will have the same files by the end of the download.

Playbook: 
Initial creation -
Follow step in order:
“tar -xvf proj1.tar”  - to unzip the file.
“javac Handler.java Message.java MessageLogger.java Pair.java Peer.java peerProcess.java” - to initialize all of the java files
“Java peerProcess -id-” - Will run a file using our peerProcess implementation.
